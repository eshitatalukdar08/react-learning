# Lesson 10 â€“ Color Box Project Challenge

This project is part of my **React learning journey (Lesson 10)**.  
The challenge was to build an interactive **Color Box** application with the following features:
- A text input where the user can enter a **color name**.  
- A box that updates its **background color** and **displayed text** based on the entered color.  
- A toggle button that switches the **text color** inside the box between **dark** and **light** for better visibility.  



##  Features

- **Dynamic Background**: Typing a valid CSS color name updates the box background instantly.  
- **Dynamic Text**: The box text changes to reflect the entered color name.  
- **Toggle Button**: Switches text color between dark (`#000`) and light (`#FFF`).  
- **Validation**: If no color is entered, the box shows `"Empty Value"`.
